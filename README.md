What is the purpose of this program(s)? to find the most common average speed
What does the program do, include what it takes for input, and what it gives as output? The input would be the data from my rollercoasters.csv, specifically the average speeds. 
And the output was the most common average speed. Which was 14.
How do you use the program? you run it and it prints "The most common average speed is: 14"
